## Overview

The Solana Account Model is a fundamental concept that defines how data and assets are stored and managed on the Solana blockchain. This section provides a comprehensive guide to understanding the account system.

## ðŸ“š Contents

### [1. Account Types](1.solana_account_types.md)

Learn about the different types of accounts in Solana:

- System Accounts (SOL holdings)
- Program Accounts (Smart Contracts)
- Data Accounts (State Storage)
- Token Accounts (SPL Tokens)
- And more specialized accounts

### [2. Account Ownership](2.solana_account_ownership.md)

Understand how account ownership works:

- Owner Programs
- Permission Systems
- Account Control Mechanisms

### [3. Rent Economics](3.solana_rent_economics.md)

Explore Solana's storage cost model:

- Rent Calculation
- Rent Exemption
- Account Lifecycle

### [4. Data Storage](4.solana_data_storage.md)

Deep dive into data storage mechanisms:

- Account Data Structure
- Storage Optimization
- On-chain vs Off-chain Storage
